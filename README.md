# Web-Scraping-on-Google-Scholar-
A `freelance job` was provided for `Upwork` client.
**For this project, we are expecting a python script that takes in a keyword on Google Scholar and save data (specified below) on the results into a .csv file.**

*The expected work would be something following this logic:*

1. User inputs keywords  
2. Script searches the keyword on Google Scholar
3. Script saves data for each result (Name, authors, year, times cited, etc.)
4. Script clicks on the next results page
5. Repeat the process for all results pages
6. Save the output as a .csv

*It might be necessary to prevent the website from blocking the scraper. It is okay if it takes the script 1 to 2 seconds to scrape each results page. Faster is preferrable.* 

In the .csv we would like columns for:
1. Name  
2. Author  
3. Publisher
4. Publication date
5. Link type (pdf, html …)
6. Cited by #
7. Type (articles, book …)
8. Free to access
